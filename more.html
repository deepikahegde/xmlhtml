	<h3>Costs</h3>
	<p>Before joining any gym, it is highly recommended that you shop around and go on a visit before joining up. You should check joining options, no joining fee, pay-as-go, free trail periods, no joining fee, First  month free, corporation discounts and off peak discounts. Avoid long term agreements which can tie you into an agreement for anything between 1-3 years!

If you are looking for a specialised class – men only, woman only or seniors etc check the gym offers this. Gyms that do offer these tend to also have specialised programs for the target market. Aquasize classes for seniors by way of an example.

During your tour you should ask about any special offers?

How many members do they currently have? (As overcrowding can result in you waiting for equipment)

What are the busy times?  Try to avoid peak times as again you may have to wait for equipment.

Also check equipment, Facilities and staff.</p>
